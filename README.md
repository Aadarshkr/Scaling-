# Scaling-
# Introduction
Scaling is the process of measuring and assigning the objects to the numbers according to the specified rules. In other words the process of locating the measured object on the continuum, a continous sequence of number to called scaling.
# Objective
Scaling technique is the process of generation the continuum a continous sequence of values, upon which the measured object are placed.
They are two type
* Comparative Scaling
* Noncomparative Scaling

* Comparative Scaling:-In comparative scaling there is a direct comparison of stimulus object.
* Noncomparative scaling:- The noncomprative scals also called aa monadic or metric scale is a scale in which each object is scaled independently of the
  other object in the stimulus setunder study.
# Why Scaling is used.?
If the data in any condition has data points far from each oter caling is a tecnique to make them closer to each other or in simpler words ew can say that the scaling is used for making data points generalized so that the distance between them will be lower
# Components of scaling.
* Bending beams.
* Shear beams.
* Double shear beams.
* Compression load cells.
* Single-point-load cells.
* S-type load cells.
